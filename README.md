# 42 Core Projects

Welcome to my repository of 42 Core projects. This repository includes several projects completed as part of the 42 curriculum. Below is a brief overview of each project.

## Projects

### `ft_printf`

`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the `printf` function from the C standard library. It supports various format specifiers and flags, providing a flexible and efficient way to format output.

- **Features:**
  - Support for standard format specifiers (`%d`, `%s`, `%x`, etc.)
  - Custom flag handling
  - Efficient and reliable

### `get_next_line`

`get_next_line` is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor. It handles the reading of lines from files or standard input, making it useful for reading files line by line.

- **Features:**
  - Reads lines from a file descriptor
  - Handles large files efficiently
  - Supports multiple file descriptors

### `libft`

`libft` is a collection of standard library functions implemented from scratch. It includes various utility functions that are commonly used in C programming.

- **Features:**
  - Implementation of standard C library functions
  - Utility functions for string manipulation, memory management, etc.
  - Modular and reusable

### `pipex`

`pipex` is a project that implements a command-line tool to handle pipes and redirections. It allows users to execute multiple commands in a pipeline and manage input/output redirections.

- **Features:**
  - Handling of pipes and redirections
  - Execution of multiple commands in a pipeline
  - Robust error handling

### `push_swap`

`push_swap` is a sorting algorithm project that aims to sort a stack of integers using a minimal number of operations. It involves implementing various sorting algorithms and optimizing their performance.

- **Features:**
  - Implementation of stack sorting algorithms
  - Optimization for minimal operations
  - Efficient handling of stack operations

### `so_long`

`so_long` is a simple game project that involves creating a basic game with graphics and user interaction. It serves as a hands-on project for learning game development fundamentals.

- **Features:**
  - Basic game mechanics and graphics
  - User interaction and event handling
  - Simple game logic and design
